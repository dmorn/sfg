# Square Foot Garden
We want to provide an interface for finding the best combinations for building an [amazing square foot garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_foot_gardening). It would also be nice to provide a bot that could answer such questions.
The idea is the system can be queried with the plants that you want it to grow. It will then reply with the configuration(s) that are most suitable for your garden, provided its dimensions.
